* **1-alphabet.c:** _Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line._
* **2-print_alphabet_x10.c* _Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line._
* **3-islower.c:** _Write a function that checks for lowercase character._
* **4-isalpha.c:** _Write a function that checks for alphabetic character._
* **5-sign.c:** _Write a function that prints the sign of a number._
* **6-abs.c:** _Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer._
* **7-print_last_digit.c:** _Write a function that prints the last digit of a number._
* **8-24_hours.c:** _Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59._
* **9-times_table.c:** _Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0._

* **11-print_to_98.c:** _Write a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line._
* **100-times_table.c:** _Write a function that prints the `n` times table, starting with 0._
* **101-natural.c:** _If we list all the natural numbers below `10` that are multiples of `3` or `5`, we get `3`, `5`, `6` and `9`. The sum of these multiples is `23`.
